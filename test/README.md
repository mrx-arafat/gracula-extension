### test-whatsapp-group.html
A standalone HTML test page that simulates a WhatsApp group chat interface for testing the extension's context extraction functionality.

- Unit tests for individual modules
- Integration tests for the full extension

## Adding New Tests

When adding new test files:
1. Place them in this `test/` directory
2. Update this README with a description
3. Ensure test files use relative paths to reference source files (e.g., `../src/...`)
