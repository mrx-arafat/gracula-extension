## Expected Results

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators:

- Button turns red when recording
- Recording indicator shows at top of page
- Transcription appears with proper punctuation
- Text is automatically inserted into input field

### Console Logs to Check:
Open browser console (F12) and look for:
```
üé§ Calling ElevenLabs API...
   MIME type: audio/webm;codecs=opus
   Language: en
   Audio blob size: XXXXX bytes
   Sending to: https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/speech-to-text
   Response status: 200
‚úÖ ElevenLabs transcription complete: [your text with punctuation]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Must provide either file or cloud_storage_url parameter"
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED in latest code
**Cause**: FormData parameter name was wrong (`audio` instead of `file`)
**Solution**: Already fixed - reload extension

### Error: "invalid_model_id - 'eleven_multilingual_v2' is not a valid model_id"
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED in latest code
**Cause**: ElevenLabs changed their model IDs. Valid models are now `scribe_v1` and `scribe_v1_experimental`
**Solution**: Already fixed - updated to use `scribe_v1` - reload extension

### Error: "ElevenLabs API key not configured"
**Check**: 
1. Open extension popup
2. Go to Voice Settings
3. Verify API key field shows: `sk_17f927bfb2297bf127c442949b9b16ab964c7b916c6cd56a`
4. If empty, the key should be auto-loaded from background.js

### Error: "Failed to start voice input"
**Solutions**:
1. Grant microphone permissions when prompted
2. Check microphone is working in system settings
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Check browser console for detailed error

### No punctuation in transcription
**Check**:
1. Verify "ElevenLabs" is selected (not "Web Speech API")
2. Check console logs show "Calling ElevenLabs API"
3. If it says "Web Speech", settings didn't apply - try saving again

### Button not appearing
**Solutions**:
1. Make sure "Enable Voice Input" toggle is ON
2. Click in the message input field
3. Wait 2-3 seconds for button to appear
4. Try refreshing the page
