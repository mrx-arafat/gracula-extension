# 🎯 Last Message Focus - Autocomplete Always Replies to Last Message

## Problem Solved
Previously, autocomplete suggestions might have been generic or not directly related to the last message. Now, **autocomplete ALWAYS focuses on replying to the LAST MESSAGE ONLY**.

---

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### Priority System:
The autocomplete now analyzes the last message with 5 priority levels:

```
Priority 1: QUESTIONS → Answer the question
Priority 2: REQUESTS → Respond to the request
Priority 3: EMOTIONS → Match the emotional tone
Priority 4: GREETINGS → Respond appropriately
Priority 5: TOPICS → Address mentioned topics
```

## 🚀 **Real Examples**

You start typing: "h"
```

**OLD Behavior (Ignored last message):**

✅ **DIRECTLY answers the "where" question!**

---

### Example 2: Request Focus
```

You start typing: "s"
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### A. **AutocompleteManager.js Changes**

Added new methods:
```javascript
analyzeLastMessage()       // Deep analysis of last message
detectQuestionType()       // What, when, where, who, why, how
detectRequestType()        // Help, send, call, meet, action
extractTopics()            // Time, location, work, social
detectEmotion()            // Excited, happy, sad, angry, etc.
```

### B. **Instant Prediction Logic**

The `getInstantPredictions()` method now follows this priority:

```javascript
if (lastMessage.isQuestion) {
  // Priority 1: Answer the question type
  switch (lastMessage.questionType) {
    case 'when': return timeAnswers;
    case 'where': return locationAnswers;
    case 'what': return informationAnswers;
    // etc.
  }
}
else if (lastMessage.isRequest) {
  // Priority 2: Respond to request type
  switch (lastMessage.requestType) {
    case 'help': return helpResponses;
    case 'send': return sendResponses;
    // etc.
  }
}
else if (lastMessage.emotion !== 'neutral') {
  // Priority 3: Match emotion
  return emotionalResponses[lastMessage.emotion];
}
// etc.
```

### C. **Background Prompt Changes**

The AI prompt now emphasizes the last message:

```
=== 🎯 CRITICAL: LAST MESSAGE (REPLY TO THIS!) ===
>>> Friend: When can we meet? <<<
⚠️  YOUR COMPLETION MUST DIRECTLY REPLY TO THIS EXACT MESSAGE!
⚠️  DO NOT reply to earlier messages in the conversation.
⚠️  ONLY address what was said in the last message above.

=== 📊 LAST MESSAGE ANALYSIS ===
Speaker: Friend
Content: "When can we meet?"
⚠️  TYPE: QUESTION (when)
→ You MUST answer this question!
📌 TOPICS: time
→ Address these topics in your reply
```

Friend: "Also, when can you send that file?"
        ↑
        LAST MESSAGE (System focuses here!)

You type: "t"
  ↓
Suggestions:
1. "tomorrow morning I'll send it"
