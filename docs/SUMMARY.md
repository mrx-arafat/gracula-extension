# Gracula Extension Improvements - Summary

## ✅ All Improvements Completed Successfully

### Overview
I've enhanced your Chrome extension to generate **significantly more accurate and contextually appropriate replies** by improving context gathering and analysis. All changes are **backward compatible** and existing features continue to work.

---

## 🎯 What Was Improved

### 1. **Quoted Message & Media Detection** ✅
**Files:** `ContextExtractor.js`, `Message.js`

- Detects when messages are replies to quoted messages
- Extracts quoted context (who said what)
- Detects 6 types of media: images, videos, audio, documents, stickers, GIFs
- Includes this in AI prompts for better understanding

**Example:**
```
Before: "Friend: Here it is"
After: "Friend: Here it is [replying to You: "Can you send that photo?"] [attached: image]"
```

---

### 2. **Semantic Intent Detection** ✅
**File:** `ConversationAnalyzer.js`

Detects what the user is trying to accomplish:
- `asking_question` - Wants to know something
- `requesting_help` - Needs assistance
- `making_plans` - Coordinating activities
- `sharing_info` - Providing information
- `expressing_emotion` - Emotional expression
- `giving_opinion` - Sharing thoughts
- `small_talk` - Casual chat
- `seeking_confirmation` - Looking for validation

**Benefit:** AI generates replies matching the conversation's purpose

---

### 3. **Emotional State Detection** ✅
**File:** `ConversationAnalyzer.js`

Detects 7 emotional states with intensity levels:
- excited, happy, worried, frustrated, confused, grateful, sad

**Benefit:** More empathetic and emotionally appropriate responses

---

### 4. **User Preference Learning** ✅
**File:** `PreferenceLearner.js` (NEW)

Learns from which replies you select:
- Tracks tone preferences (which tones you use most)
- Tracks length preferences (short/medium/long)
- Tracks selection patterns (which of 3 options you pick)
- Builds confidence over time
- Stores in `chrome.storage.local`

**Benefit:** Adapts to your personal style automatically

---

### 5. **Conversation Summarization** ✅
**File:** `ConversationSummarizer.js` (NEW)

For conversations > 28 messages:
- Creates concise summary of older messages
- Keeps recent 28 messages intact
- Reduces token usage while preserving context

**Example Summary:**
```
📋 CONVERSATION SUMMARY: Earlier: 45 messages over 2 days between You, Sarah
(active dialogue). Discussed: project, deadline, design. Sarah asked:
"When can you finish the prototype?". Shared 3 image/document.
```

**Benefit:** Handles long conversations without losing context or hitting token limits

---

### 6. **Enhanced Prompt Building** ✅
**File:** `background.js`

Improved AI prompts now include:
- User intent with confidence level
- Emotional state and intensity
- Prioritized information (questions, urgency, topics)
- Better context organization

**Benefit:** More relevant and accurate reply generation

---

## 📊 Impact on Reply Quality

### Before:
```
AI Prompt:
"Friend: Are you free tomorrow?"

Generated Replies:
1. "Yes"
2. "Maybe"
3. "I'll check"
```

### After:
```
AI Prompt:
Intent: making_plans (high confidence)
Emotional State: neutral
Last Speaker: Friend
Conversation Type: dialogue
Recent pace: rapid (~45s gaps)
Style: casual, mixed English/Bangla, uses emojis

Generated Replies:
1. "Yeah hoye jabe! What time works for you? 😊"
2. "Tomorrow sounds good! Morning or afternoon?"
3. "Sure! Ektu details dao, ki plan?"
```

**Result: Context-aware, style-matched, culturally appropriate responses!**
